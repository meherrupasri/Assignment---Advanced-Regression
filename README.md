# Assignment---Advanced-Regression
A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price.
Welcome to the Advanced Regression Analysis project for Surprise Housing. This repository is dedicated to understanding the housing market dynamics in Australia, leveraging machine learning methodologies to predict house prices. Surprise Housing, a US-based firm, intends to utilize this data-driven approach to identify undervalued properties and generate a substantial return on investment.
**#Project Overview**
The crux of this project involves constructing a predictive model using Ridge and Lasso regression, regularisation techniques that prevent overfitting and allow for better model performance. This model aims to determine the fair market value of potential investment properties, enabling the company to make informed purchasing decisions.
